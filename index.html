        <p>I am a computer science student at the University of Waterloo, currently doing work related to database 
           management, and developing software for internal use to be used alongside our ERP software.</p>
        <p>I have a project I have taken more seriously:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://animmexapi.site/" target="_blank">AnimmexAPI</a>, a C# wrapper 
		for performing various actions on Animmex, a Russian video streaming site. They currently have no 
		    official API, so this is a substitute. <b>Note:</b> Animmex no longer exists.</li>
	    <li><a href="http://sharpthemes.pw/" target="_blank">SharpThemes</a>, a C# wrapper
		for performing various actions on 3DSThem.es, allowing you to search and obtain information on the 
		custom splash screens, badges and themes available on the site. There is no public API documentation at
		the current time, so this attempts to make obtaining data extremely clear.</li>
	    <li><a href="http://github.com/kade-robertson/NTRDB.NET" target="_blank">NTRDB.NET</a>, a C# wrapper
		for browsing and searching plugins on <a href="http://ntrdb.octonezd.pw/" target="_blank">NTRDB</a>,
		which allows users to submit and download plugins for NTR on 3DS systems. Currently the provided API
		is fairly barebones, so this project will continue to grow as the API grows as well. <b>Note:</b>
		NTRDB is no longer online.</li>
	    <li><a href="http://github.com/kade-robertson/UWaterlooAPIDotNet" target="_blank">UWaterlooAPIDotNet</a>, 
		a C# wrapper for the UWaterloo API. All of the methods are available in synchronous or asynchronous
		versions, something I have not done previously. Every endpoint provided by the university (85 in total)
		has been implemented, with models specifically built for each request. <b>Note:</b> The API is going
		to be changed in the near future, this will be re-done to meet the new spec.</li>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/universities" target="_blank">universities</a>, a Python
		library which can search through a database of basic information for thousands of universities.</li>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/EmojiAPI" target="_blank">EmojiAPI</a>, a RESTful API that
		allows users to translate betweeon Emoji codes and unicode (my first venture into Python web devlopment.</li>
        </ul>
	<p>I also have started becoming interested in developing browser extensions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remsidebar/jlidfffnlmgaihkkkjamfejeejdohpmd">remsidebar</a>,
		    a browser extension which removes intrusive sidebars on Reddit threads, which are especially bothersome
		    when tiling windows.
	</ul>
        <p>A lot of my GitHub activity is based around esoteric programming languages. I have created interpreters for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/pythuhn" target="_blank">Huh?</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/pythook" target="_blank">Ook!</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/pydevelopers" target="_blank">Developers</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Furthermore, I have worked on developing my own, equally esoteric languages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/pylasma" target="_blank">lindenMASM + pylasma</a>, pylasma 
		being an interpreter for the LindenMASM programming language I created, specifically for the purposes 
		of drawing Lindenmayer systems.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/stuck" target="_blank">stuck</a>, a stack-based code-golfing 
		language, that is now famous for having the <a href="http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/55425" target="_blank">
		shortest possible “Hello, World! solution</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/haystack" target="_blank">haystack</a>, another stack-based 
		language, however the source file is navigated in 2 dimensions, with full control over the direction.
		Execution ends when it finds the needle in the haystack.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/tone-deaf" target="_blank">tone-deaf</a>, a third stack-based 
		language, where the source code is intended to look like guitar chords (with optional lyrics).</li>
        </ul>
	<p>There are also some projects that I have begun work on, but they have lost priority due to various issues, such as:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/YTSDotNet" target="_blank">YTSDotNet</a>, a wrapper for the
		YTS API. Unfortunately, this hasn't been continued since, while there is documentation available, a lot
		of the "endpoints" for the API are dead links. If they are ever restored I will work on this further.</li>
	</ul>
